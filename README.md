# hello-world
My first repository!
I've decided to learn how to program and have taken 2 Python courses through edX. I decided to do a series of projects through Manning and GitHub is one way of posting your solutions. So that gave me a good opportunity to start using it. I am using Python right now and plan on getting involved with some open source projects once I learn more.
